# Hey, I'm Randy Duran 👋

I'm a cloud-focused developer working at the intersection of clean code, thoughtful architecture, and real-world impact.

### 🧰 My Toolbox
- **Languages & Frameworks:** TypeScript, Python, Node.js, Flask, FastAPI  
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, CI/CD, PostgreSQL  
- **What I value:** Clarity, scalability, and simplicity in every line of code

### 🔍 What Drives Me
I build backends with brains — systems that aren’t just scalable, but **understandable**, **intentional**, and **built to last**.  
In a world chasing automation, I focus on meaning — building tools that make sense to the people who use them and maintain them.

I believe great software balances architecture with empathy. It's not just about getting things done, but understanding *why* they should be done at all.

### 🚀 What I'm Building
- Soon

### 🧠 Always Learning
From clean backend design to smarter tooling, I’m always evolving how I think and build.  
Not everything should scale infinitely — some things just need to make sense.

Open to collaboration, freelancing, or a good tech chat.
